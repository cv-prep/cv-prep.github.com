| At **CV and Interview Prep** we work towards helping all professionals obtain their dream job.

Although we specialise in grads and junior positions, you'll see in our case studies that we can help at
any level of experience.

The organisation was born out of frustrations at university, never being able to get enough contact time
with career and employment advisors to help with any part of the application process. Then any time we got
felt more like a production farm, not getting a specialised or bespoke service. 
We understood that these parts of universities tend to be underfunded and resources are spread thin.

We have since grown from providing just CV assistance to giving 1-to-1 sessions for interview help and
preparation. Similarly, we have grown from targetting just junior roles, to being able to help across the 
board.

We have not changed our process. We take each application on an individual basis. Spending time to understand 
the applicant to ensure we are able to truly offer a premium service.

Here, we try to truly understand you. Really get into the details of your skills and experience, to ensure
that we're able to give you the best chance of getting your desired role. We work with each of you on an 
individual level to make sure we're able to highlight and omit different bits of information to really 
maximise the precious space available on your CV.
