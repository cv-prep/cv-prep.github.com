Micheal has several years of experience leading local and global teams for a multinational corp. However, 
he felt his role, though gave a lot of responsibility and was thoroughly enjoyable, lacked the weight to
make significant strategic decisions.

Michael came to us looking to amend his CV for an entirely different role. To sit on the board of a charity
as a part-time Trustee.
We spent time understanding his current role and what responsibilities Michael had inside and outside of
work to craft a CV that outlined his skills and strategic aptitude.

A first time for us, but a fantastic success story.
