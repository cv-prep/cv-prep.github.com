Kevin had spent time at a few larger financial services firms. However, some of the baggage of large 
organisations started to set in. A move to a smaller start up looked like the right approach.

When Kevin reached out, his CV was extremely comprehensive, from a professional view, and he was able to 
articulate the key skills and projects he had been involved in across his previous roles for an interview.

The work we did with Kevin was to help remove the corporate vail over his CV and approach to the new role.
We helped highlight not only the key results obtained in his role at the time, but to really showcase the 
passion in his work. Both in his CV and the way he answered questions in the interview stage.

This helped Kevin achieve his move to a much smaller organisation and become a pivotal member of a far
smaller team.
