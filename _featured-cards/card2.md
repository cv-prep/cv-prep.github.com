project_summary: CV and Interview Prep to help make a first job change

Pam worked at one of the large consultancies from the moment she graduated. She enjoyed the work, but felt
that progress was extremely rigid and similarly pay too.

She looked to move from her auditing function to an internal risk group at a large multinational. However,
the only CV she had was geared towards showcasing her achievements in education and was light on experience
and skills. Also, she had not done an interview for 3 years and had no idea what kind of questions would be 
asked.

The time we spent with Pam allowed us to understand the skills, roles and responsibilities she gained over
the 3 years in the world of work. The result? A brand new CV and interview coaching that enabled her to get
the role she was aiming for.

New responsibilities and a new pay cheque for a deserving individual.
