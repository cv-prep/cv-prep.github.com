Jim, studying Computer Science, was looking to get a placement at a firm to put into action the skills picked
up over 1st and 2nd year of University.

After a few attempts, Jim fell short at different stages of the application process for multiple tech and 
financial services firms - this is when he reached out to us.

We gave his CV a complete make over and pinpointed some of the strengths to really showcase in the 
interview/assessment center. This helped Jim obtain a successful offer from a large multinational bank.
